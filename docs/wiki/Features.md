# Features

kAIcad brings AI-powered intelligence to your KiCad workflow. Here's what makes it powerful.

## üéØ Core Capabilities

### Natural Language Circuit Design

Describe what you want in plain English:

```
"Add a voltage divider with 10kŒ© and 5kŒ© resistors"
"Connect the LED cathode to ground through a 330Œ© resistor"
"Place a decoupling capacitor near the microcontroller"
```

The AI understands context, relationships, and electronic design patterns.

### Smart Symbol Search

kAIcad automatically searches your KiCad symbol libraries:

- Fuzzy matching for component names
- Understanding of common abbreviations (LED, MCU, etc.)
- Support for specific values and packages
- Fallback to generic symbols when needed

### Intelligent Placement

Components are placed logically:

- Respects existing layout
- Maintains reasonable spacing
- Groups related components
- Avoids overlapping existing elements

### Automatic Wiring

kAIcad can connect components intelligently:

- Point-to-point connections
- Bus connections
- Net label creation
- Power and ground connections

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Batch Processing

Process multiple commands:

```python
from kaicad.core.planner import plan_from_prompt
from kaicad.core.writer import apply_plan

for command in commands:
    plan = plan_from_prompt(command)
    apply_plan(schematic, plan)
```

### Scripting Support

Use kAIcad in your own scripts:

```python
from kaicad import Schematic, Designer

sch = Schematic.from_file("circuit.kicad_sch")
designer = Designer(sch)

designer.add_component("LED", position=(100, 100))
designer.add_resistor("330Œ©", position=(120, 100))
designer.connect("LED:A", "R1:1")

sch.save()
```
